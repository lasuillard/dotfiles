## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions

There are several GitHub Actions workflows defined in this repository to automate various tasks. Below is a brief description of each workflow:

### ‚úÖ CI

This workflow is used to run continuous integration (CI) checks to validate the configuration files and scripts in this repository by installing them in a Linux (Docker), macOS, and Windows environment.

Test job in CI will not run by default. It can be enabled by setting the `CI_PLATFORMS_TO_TEST` variable (e.g. 'linux,macos,windows') in the repository settings.

### üîÑ Sync with Upstream

This workflow is used to sync the current repository with the upstream repository.

It fetches the latest changes from the upstream repository and merges them into the current branch. This is useful for keeping your fork up to date with the original repository.

This workflow is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the `SYNC_UPSTREAM` variable to the target repository URL in the repository settings.
